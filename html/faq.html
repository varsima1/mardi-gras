          <summary>Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It
            belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses that
            offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras
            website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell
            their products or services to those who do not know better. Products
            or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each
            individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise.
            In some parts of the country, official organizations control their
            Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

          <summary>When does Mardi Gras start and end?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day
            (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is
            on a different day each year.

            What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I
            pack?
          </summary>
          <p class="text">
            The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm,
            almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other
            during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a
            chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon. Since you will be
            spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that
            can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain.
            If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a
            raincoat!

          <summary>How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras
            beads and throws. That's why we call it the "Greatest Free Show on
            Earth!"

            I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during
            Mardi Gras?
          </summary>
          <p class="text">
            The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New
            Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and
            Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
            streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and
            Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend,
            Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to
            experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that
            Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On
            Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the
            costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

          <summary>What happens if there is bad weather?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if
            the weather is predicted to be severe. The local TV and radio news
            stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates.

          <p class="text">
            Yes! You can enjoy New Orleans with your children knowing they will
            have all of the comforts of home by renting baby/toddler gear from
            Rockabye Baby Rentals. They rent everything from full-sized wood
            cribs to pack ‘n plays and bassinets, all with freshly laundered
            linens. They also provide strollers, joggers, and even bottle

            If you would like to sell Mardi Gras souvenirs or pre-packaged food
            you'll need a permit from the city of New Orleans. Prices range from
            $500 to $2,000 depending on whether you'll be walking or have a
            fixed location. Learn more about permit details.

          <summary>Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun
            that begins on January 6 (see question below) and ends on Mardi Gras
            (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when
            Lent begins. It is also common for people to refer to the entire
            season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat Tuesday "Mardi
            Gras Day." Locals tend to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the
            last two weekends leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi Gras."

          <summary>Why are masks worn?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday,
            masking is legal for everyone else, and the elaborate masks that
            some wear add to the fun.

          <summary>How is a king chosen?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some
            krewes hold random drawings, while others invite a celebrity guest
            to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School
            of Design, who sponsors the Rex parade. His identity is revealed the
            day before the parade.

            How does Mardi Gras benefit the New Orleans economy?
          </summary>
          <p class="text">
            Economic impact reports indicate that Mardi Gras generates over $1
            billion in annual spending.

        <details>
          <summary>How is the City government involved?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            City governments are not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras
            parades. The governments issue parade permits, but that is the
            extent of their involvement. Krewes independently schedule and
            coordinate their own parades.

        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Who organizes and pays for Mardi Gras?</summary>
          <p class="text">
            Mardi Gras parade krewes are private, non-profit organizations whose
            members get together year round to plan their parade's theme,
            costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club, as they are known,
            is individually funded by its members. They support their krewe
            through dues, sales of krewe-related merchandise to their members,
            and fundraising. Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes have corporate
            sponsors. The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating
            Mardi Gras parades; their only involvement is to issue parade
            permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that schedules and
            coordinates its own parade.
