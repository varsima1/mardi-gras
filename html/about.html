        <div class="about">
          <p>
            The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing
            through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French
            House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
            Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies. On March 2,
            1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de
            Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New
            Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized
            it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established
            "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703,
            the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's
            very first Mardi Gras. In 1704, Mobile established a secret society
            (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current Mardi
            Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society"
            was formed and paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was
            held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men.
            Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and
            signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
            New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s,
            Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans, but not with the
            parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
            Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which
            became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today. The
            earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report
            to the Spanish colonial governing body. That year, the Perseverance
            Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of
            clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans. By the late
            1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages
            and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight
            torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and
            lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856,
            six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking
            John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus
            brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known
            as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained
            anonymous. In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night
            Revelers, was formed. This is also the first recorded account of
            Mardi Gras "throws." Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events
            in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition" lithographs of
            parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course -
            themes and floats were always carefully guarded before the
            procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details
            could not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus'
            parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be
            produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and
            costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A.
            Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to life by
            talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40
            years was responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and
            processional outfits. 1872 was the year that a group of businessmen
            invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the first daytime
            parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff,
            the businessmen introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple, green
            and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice;
            gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras
            season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love,"
            was cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune. The
            following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New
            Orleans instead of France, culminating with Comus' magnificent "The
            Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic
            paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock
            both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry
            Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act,"
            making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.
            Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes
            today developed from private social clubs with restrictive
            membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are
            completely funded by their members, New Orleanians call it the
            "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"
